# Central-Limit-Theorem-
Explaining the use of Central Limit Theorem using Airline Dataset

Central limit theorem is simply state as a sample size grows, the sample mean gets closer to the population mean.

There are main 4 step that needs to followed to archive Central Limit Theorem

1.Sample mean will be less spread than the whole population.

2.Normal Distribution will get closer by increasing the number of sample size.

3.Spread of sample distribution is related to the population distribution.

4.Bigger sample lead to smaller spread in sample distribution.
