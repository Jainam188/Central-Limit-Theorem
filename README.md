Explaining the use of Central Limit Theorem using Airline Dataset

Central limit theorem is simply state as a sample size grows, the sample mean gets closer to the population mean.

Main 4 step that needs to followed to archive Central Limit Theorem

1. Sample mean will be less spread than the whole population.

2. Normal Distribution will get closer by increasing the number of sample size.

3. Spread of sample distribution is related to the population distribution.

4. Bigger sample lead to smaller spread in sample distribution.

I have used the Central Limit Theorem concept to find the delay time of flights using the Airlines dataset.It will help me to find the best flight that will help me to reach my destination on time.

I have used Histogram to visualize my dataset and help me to understand more and it will produce 20 graph images for every random sample
and when you see the final image normal distribution it will be same the whole population normal distribution.

If you want to learn more than try to visualize all the graph into a GIF image that will help to represent the concept of central limit theorem.
